Vulnerabilities:
- The code does not handle potential exceptions that may occur when working with dates, such as invalid year or month values.
- The code does not validate user input, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- The code uses magic numbers (e.g., `9` in `print_month_name(2024, 9)`), which should be replaced with named constants for better readability and maintainability.
- The code does not follow the principle of single responsibility, as the `main` function is responsible for both executing the program and printing the results.
- The code does not include any documentation or comments to explain its purpose, usage, or implementation details.
Fixes:
- Add try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions when working with dates.
- Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and ranges.
- Replace magic numbers with named constants.
- Refactor the code to follow the principle of single responsibility.
- Add documentation and comments to explain the code's purpose, usage, and implementation details.
Verdict: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
